# Weather-Project


Problem Statement: This website was created to help people prepare for how to dress for the day (warm weather, cold weather, rainy weather, etc). As well as help people know if the outside weather is dangerous (severe heat or sever cold). 

Target end-user: Any users who are interested in knowing the current weather. We support global weather research around the globe via our city search page and for our US customers who want accurate weather readings, we have our zipcode search page.
